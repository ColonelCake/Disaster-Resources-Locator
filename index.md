## Introduction
***
The Disaster Resources Locator is an application for the management of resources crucial to those involved in a disaster incident. 
With this application, suppliers and clients will be able to exchange valuable resources through sales and/or donations efficiently along with facilitated functions for browsing, searching, and requesting various items.

1. User Accounts is the building block for all other accounts. Given that the majority of attributes(Username, Names, email, phones, etc.) within supplier, requester, and administrator are the same, personal information is stored in the user account while specific IDs and locations are stored in the Admin, Supplier, and Requester tables.

2. Suppliers can perform a variety of functions. The entity does not contain many attributes as it “inherits” the majority of information from the User Accounts table. Among the many things a supplier can do, a supplier can register as a Company employee (see Company table). Suppliers’ main role is to stock Resources and post Listings which announce the availability of a Resource to be reserved or purchased. Suppliers receive Payments from Orders placed by Requesters after responding to a Request. This is the purchase or donation mechanic of the application, wherein a Requester reserves a good either with or without cost.

3. Company is where the corporate details of the company being represented (supplier registered as company) reside. This table is a way for employees to identify as a representative to a specific company. When Payments are made, the Company (not the Supplier) receives the payment from the Requester. All Listings and responses to Requests however, are handled by the Supplier who is a company employee if they do not operate independently.

4. Requesters represent the clients seeking the various resources tracked by the application. They post Requests to let Suppliers know they are seeking a certain Resource, from which they receive a notification and a reply when their resource becomes available and a Supplier wishes to transact. Then, the Requester can place an order for the requested Resource in addition to sending the pertinent payment, if applicable. Requesters also help let Suppliers know what kind of resources are in demand through the Requests.

5. Listings announce the availability and sale or donation of a resource. Listings display which resource is being supplied, who is supplying the resource, the date of the listing post, location of the resource, and how much of the specific resource is being sold. Listings can only be posted by Suppliers. When a specific resource is Requested by a Requester, the supplier is notified to respond to this Request. Once the Request is accepted, the Requester can place an Order which displays the completion of the transaction. In the case that the Listing is of a large quantity, and a Requester only purchases an amount less than the entirety of the stock, the quantity in the listing is reduced. In the case that all of the stock is purchased, quantity in the listing becomes 0 and the listing is no longer displayed.

6. Requests announce the need for a resource by a Requester user. The table displays the status of the Request (accepted, pending, etc.), the resource needed (rid), the quantity of the resource needed and the Date in which the request was posted. Requests can only be posted by Requesters, and are accepted/rejected by Suppliers, who own the resources solicited in the Request. The acceptance of a Request allows the Requester to place an Order, through which the transaction of the resource takes place.

7. An Order, as mentioned previously, is created when a Requester places it through an accepted Request. Order acts as a log of all the information pertinent to a transaction: the Requester’s ID, the Supplier’s ID, Payment ID, Resource ID being exchanged/donated, quantity of the resource being donated, and the status of the Order, which tracks the exchange of the named resources and details whether its being processed, is fully completed, etc.

8. Resource is the table with all the information pertinent to an existing resource. This includes: its ID (rid), its name, its Supplier’s ID, and the department (rtype) the item belongs to. The department it belongs to leads us to the rest of the resource’s information related to the various Resource subtypes (ISA): e.g. Fuel, Clothing, Medication, Batteries, etc. Each of these departments contain their own attributes describing the specifications of each kind: e.g. Water brand, size. Fuel type, quantity, etc.

9. Payment is the table containing the specifics to fulfill an Order’s payment. It has attributes for the Requester ID of who submitted the payment, the Supplier ID it is addressed to, the amount (price) being paid, the payment type (visa card#, exp date, sec code), and the account details of the Supplier to which the payment is being sent.

10. Administrator accounts are in charge of registering and managing other types of user accounts. These contain higher privileges to make changes in the application. However, the relationships of the administrator are not included in the ER since they are not detailed in the current phase of the project.
